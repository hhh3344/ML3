In other words, an autoencoder, once trained on appropriate training data, can be used to generate compressed copies of an input data point which preserve most of the information (features) in the input using significantly fewer bits of information. \n","\n","Technically speaking, an autoencoder is any neural network with three components: an encoding function (which translates the data into a simpler space, e.g. a hidden layer with fewer nodes than on the input layer), a decoding function (which reverses this process, e.g. an output layer with equivalently many nodes as the input layer) and a distance metric (which measures loss as some distance between the original input and learned representation). The earliest type of autoencoders are [Restricted Boltzman Machines](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/restricted-boltzmann-machines-and-pretraining/notebook), which are important enough to the history of deep learning that they get their own name cred.\n","\n","Autoencoders are the neural network equivalent of simpler variable compression techniques, like [PCA](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/dimensionality-reduction-and-pca-for-fashion-mnist/) and [LDA](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/linear-discriminant-analysis-with-pokemon-stats). Autoencoders are practically used in deep learning applications for **pretraining**: determining the \"right\" weights for a neural network ahead of time, so that the algorithm doesn't have to work as hard to converge as it would if it had to start with completely random weights. For more on pretraining see [my notebook on RBMs](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/restricted-boltzmann-machines-and-pretraining/notebook). In practice, the emergence of [faster convergence algorithms](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/neural-network-activation-functions) has obviated the need and utility for pretraining.\n","\n","Thus autoencoders are no longer used in cutting edge deep learning work. They're also not notably better than simpler (usually information-theoretic) compression algorithms, like JPEG and MG3, in commercial applications. These days they're most used as a preprocessing step on high-dimensionality data before input to T-SNE.\n","\n","But they are nevertheless historically and pedologically important.\n","\n","This notebook based on [this blog post](https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html).\n","\n","here is a first change."]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5bbb0cbef09ee12ef5a55fa1362313cc1736910f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Demo\n","### Single-layer\n","\n","The simplest possible autoencoder is a single hidden layer of $n < \\text{# of input pixels}$ nodes.
